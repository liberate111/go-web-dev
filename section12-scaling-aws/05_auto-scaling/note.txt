Create auto scaling

Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances. Auto Scaling can also automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs. Auto Scaling is well suited both to applications that have stable demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.
Configure auto scaling

    EC2 / autoscaling / launch configuration
    create auto scaling group / create launch configuration

Create auto scaling group

    Configure auto scaling group

    name: auto-scale-group-2019-10-31
    group size: this is the minimum number of instances we'll always be running
    network: default vpc
    subnet: choose the availability zones (AZs) into which you've launched instances
    advanced details
        load balancing: check "receive traffic from elastic load balancer"
        select your load balancer
        health check: ELB (this is what we set up)

    configure scaling policies

    keep group at initial size

    configure tags
        value: web-server-auto-scaled
    create auto scaling group
    Scaling policies

    this is where we'd add policies to say when we scale up / scale down
